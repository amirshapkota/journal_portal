# Phase 5: Advanced Features - Implementation Summary

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 focuses on advanced features and external integrations for the journal portal, with an emphasis on interoperability, automation, and future AI/ML capabilities. This phase is divided into three main sub-phases, with significant progress made on external API integrations and OJS bidirectional sync.
